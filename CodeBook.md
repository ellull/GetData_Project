Raw data
========

Raw data can be obtained from the following URL:
    https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

This raw data was generated by 30 volunteers which performed six different activities wearing a Smartphone on the waist that captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. These signals were processed to generate the whole data set. Please see README.txt in the downloadable ZIP file for details.

Summarization process
=====================
# From all the variables available on the raw data set, only the mean and standard deviation for each measurement were extracted
# From the resulting occurrences the average of each variable for each activity and each subject was calculated resulting in 180 rows, one for each (activity, subject) pair (6 activities * 30 subjects = 180 rows)
